       When a new movement in art 《1.attains》 a 《2.certain》 fashion, it is 《3.advisable》 to find out what its 《4.advocates》 are aiming at,
     for, however farfetched and unreasonable their 《6.principles》 may seem today, it is possible that in years to come they may be 《regarded》 as normal.
     With regard to Futurist poetry, however, the case is rather difficulty for whatever Futurist poetry may be—even admitting
     that the theory on which it is based may be right—it can hardly be 《classed as Literature》.

     当一个新的时刻在艺术上《1.获得;达到》一个《2.必然的》潮流，这是《3.明智的》可以查出《4.拥护者》瞄准的是什么。
     对次，然而 《5.不可及》的和不合理的是这些《6.原则》在今天看来，在未来也许会《视为；尊敬;对....》普通一样是可能的。
     伴随着对未来诗歌,这个情况是比未来诗歌被每个人接受要困难的。
     即使那是正确的也很难被《归入文学类》

    /**  This, in 《1.brief》 ,is what the Futurist says: for a century, past 《2.conditions》 of life have been conditionally speeding up,
     till now we live in a world of noise and 《4.violence》 and speed. Consequently, our feelings, thoughts and 《emotions》
     have 《undergone;experience》 a 《5.corresponding》 change. This speeding up of life, says the Futurist, requires a new form of 《6.expression》.
     We must speed up our literature too, if we want to interpret modem stress. We must pour out a large stream of essential words,
     《7.unhampered;hinder》 by stops, or qualifying adjectives, or finite verbs. Instead of describing sounds we must make up words that imitate them;
     we must use many sizes of type and different colored 《inks》 on the same page, and shorten or lengthen words at will。

     简单(《1.简短的》)来说,未来主义说:过去的一个世纪,过去的生活《2.条件；candidate:候选人》一直是有条件快速提高的,
     《3.朝着》现在我们生活的吵杂和《4.暴力》和高速的世界。因此，我们感觉，我思考并且《情绪》
     已经《经历;经历体验》《5.相应的》改变。这种生活加速,未来主义者说，需要一风格新的《6.表达方式》。
     《7.无妨碍》的停止，形容词,动词。我们创造词汇模仿他们而不是声音，
     我们必须在同一页使用许多不同类型和大写的彩色墨水，或短或长的单词。

      /**  Certainly their descriptions of 《battles；war》 are 《1.confused》. But it is a little upsetting to read in the 《2.explanatory》 notes
     that a certain line describes a fight between a Turkish and a Bulgarian officer on a bridge off which they
     both fall into the river—and then to find that the line consists of the noise of their falling and the weights of the officers:
     “ Pluff! Pluff! A hundred and eighty-five kilograms."

       当然，他们对《战争,将军;战争》描述是《混乱的》.但是有些沮丧的在读到《说明》笔记，
      那确实是一行诗描述土耳其和保加利亚的官员在一座桥上，这句诗有噪音和他们官员体重组成：
       普通普通 一个100kg一个85KG.

       This, though it fulfills the laws and requirements of Futurist poetry, can hardly be classed as Literature. All the same,
      no thinking man can refuse to accept their first 《proposition》: that a great change in our emotional life calls for a change of expression.
      The whole question is really this: have we essentially changed?
      通过符合和未来主义诗歌的需求,归入文学是困难的，尽管如此
       没有一个有思考的人能拒绝接受他们第一个《观点》：表达改变在我们情绪化生活中是一个不错的改变。
