         A history of long and effortless success can be a 《1.dreadful handicap》, but, if 《2.properly》 handled,
     it may become a driving force. When the United States entered just such a glowing period after the end of the Second World War,
     it had a market eight times larger than any 《5.competitor》, giving its industries 《.unparalleled》 economies of 《6.scale》.
     Its scientists were the world's best, its workers the most skilled. America and Americans were 《7.prosperous》
     beyond the dreams of the Europeans and Asians whose economies the war had destroyed.

        It was 《1.inevitable》 that this 《2.primacy》 should have narrowed as other countries grew richer.
     Just as inevitably, the 《3.retreat》 from 《4.predominance》 proved 《6.painful》. By the mid-1980s Americans had found themselves at a loss over
     their 《7.fading》 industrial competitiveness. Some huge American industries, such as consumer 《8.electronics》,
     had 《9.shrunk or vanished》 in the face of foreign competition. By 1987 there was only one American television maker left,
     Zenith.(Now there is none: Zenith was bought by South Korea's LG Electronics in July。)
     {12 answer.Foreign-made cars and 《9.textiles》 were 《sweeping》 into the 《domestic》 market America's machine-tool industry was on the ropes.}
     For a while it looked as though the making of 《semiconductors》, which America had which sat at the heart of the new computer age, was going to be the next 《casualty》.

         All of this caused a 《2.crisis》 of 《1.confidence》. Americans stopped taking 《3.prosperity》 for 《4.granted》. They began to believe that their way of doing business was failing,
     and that their incomes would therefore shortly begin to fall as well. The mid・l980s brought one inquiry after another into the causes of America's industrial decline.
     Their sometimes sensational findings were filled with warnings about the growing competition from overseas .

        How things have changed! In 1995 the United States can look back on five years of solid growth while Japan has been 《struggling》.
     Few Americans attribute this 《1.solely》 to such 《2.obvious》 causes as a 《devalued》 dollar or the turning of the business cycle.
     Self-doubt has yielded to blind pride.“ American industry has changed its structure, has gone on a diet, has learnt to be more quick-witted,
     according to Richard Cavanagh, 《3.executive dean》 of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government,4'It makes me 《proud》 to be an American just to see
     how our businesses are improving their productivity,says Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute, a 《think-tank》 in Washington,
     DC. And William Sahlman of the Harvard Business School believes that people will look back on this 《period》 as "a golden age of business management in the United States”
