       Being a man has always been dangerous. There are about 105 《1.males》 born for every 100 《2.females》,
  but this ratio drops to near balance at the age of 《3.maturity》, and among 70-year-olds there are twice as many women as men.
  But the great universal of male 《4.mortality》 is being changed. Now, boy babies survive almost as well as girls do.
  This means that, for the first time, there will be an 《5.excess》 of boys in those crucial years when they are searching for a 《7.mate》.
  More important, another chance for natural selection has been removed. Fifty years ago,
  the chance of a baby(particularly a boy baby) surviving depended on its weight. A kilogram too light or too heavy meant almost certain death.
  Today it makes almost no difference. Since much of the 《8.variation》 is 《9.due》 to genes, one more agent of evolution has gone。
    成为一个男人是危险的，没诞生100各个女的就会有105个男的，
   但是这个比例在下降趋于平衡在《3.成熟；成年》后，70岁的老人中女人时男人的两倍
   但是这个男人普遍《4.死亡率》不寻常的情况正在改变。现在男婴和女婴的存活率几乎一样。
   这意味着，首次，他们将变得《5.过剩》在他们寻找《7.配偶》的《6.重要》年纪
   更重要的是，另一个自然选择已经被移除，五年前
   孩子存活的机会靠他们的体重(尤其是男孩),一千克的体重意味着体重几乎肯定死亡。
   今天几乎没啥不一样，自从许多的《8.变异》基因导致的，一个进化代理已经消失。

  /** There is another way to commit evolutionary 《1.suicide》: stay alive, but have fewer children. Few people are as 《2.fertile》 as in the past.
  Except in some 《3.religious》 communities, very few women have 15 children。 Nowadays the number of births, like the age of death,
  has become average. Most of us have 《4.roughly》 the same number of offspring. Again,
  differences between people and the opportunity for natural selection to take 《advantage》 of it have 《5.diminished.》
  India shows what is happening. The country offers wealth for a few in the great cities and poverty for the remaining tribal peoples.
  The 《grand mediocrity》 of today—everyone being the same in survival and number of offspring means that natural selection has lost 80%
  of its power in upper-middle-class India compared to the tribes。
  这是另外一种进化方式《1.自杀》:保持活着，单有少生一些孩子，在以前很少一部分人是有钱人.
  除了一些《3.古老的》群落很少有女人生15个孩子，今天这个出生的数字，像死亡年龄一样。
  已经变得平均了.《4.粗略的》算下的我们有相同的后代，
  人与人不同的是已经《5.削弱；减少》了自然选择的机会《优势》。
   印度展示了这是如何发生的。这个国家在城市中有很少的富人并且仅剩的部落的穷人，
  今天《很大程度上》每个活着的人已经和别人后代一样了，自然选择已经失去了80%的作用，相比于部落与印度中上层。

    /**  For us, this means that evolution is over; the biological Utopia has arrived. Strangely, it has involved little physical change.
  No other 《1.species》 fills so many places in nature. But in the past 100,000 years—ven the past 100 years―our
  lives have been transformed but our bodies have not.
  We did not evolve, because machines and society did it for us. Darwin had a phrase to describe those ignorant of evolution:
  “they look at an 《organic》 being as average looks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his 《comprehension》 .”
  No doubt we will remember a 20th century way of life beyond 《2.comprehension》 for its ugliness. But however amazed our 《3.descendants》 may
  be at how far from Utopia we were, they will look just like us

     这意味着我们的进化已经到头了；生物乌托邦已经到了.奇怪的是，有一点物理改变牵涉其中
     没有其他的物种充满如此多大自然的其他地方。在过去的10000年和近100年
     我们生活已经转变但是我们身体没有边
     我们没有进化，因为机器和社会帮我们做了.达尔文已经有短语描述了这些忽略性的进化：
     他们看《1.有机生物》就像看一条船，在有些事情上他们超越了他们《2.理解包容》
     毫无疑问我们将记住20世纪的生活方式超越理解的丑陋，然而令人惊奇的是我们《3.后代》也许会到达离我们不远的乌托邦，他们样子离我们查不了多少
