      the publisher of radical books who takes his 《meals》 in three-star restaurants; the journalist 《11.advocating》 《12.participatory》 democracy
      in all phases of life, whose own children are 《enrolled》 in private schools. For such people and many more perhaps not so exceptional,
      the proper formulation is," Succeed at all costs but avoid appearing ambitious."
          The 《1.attacks》 on ambition are many and come from 《2.various angles》; its public defenders are few and unimpressive,
      where they are not 《3.extremely》 《4.unattractive》. As a result, the support for ambition as a healthy 《impulse》,
      a quality to be admired and 《5.fixed》 in the mind of the young, is probably lower than it has ever been in the United States.
      This does not mean that ambition is at an end, that people no longer feel its 《6.stirrings》 and 《7.promptings》, but only that,
      no longer openly honored, it is less openly professed. Consequences follow from this, of course,
      some of which are that ambition is driven underground, or made sly. Such, then, is the way things stand: on the left angry critics,
      on the right stupid supporters, and in the middle, as usual, the majority of earnest people trying to get on in life.
