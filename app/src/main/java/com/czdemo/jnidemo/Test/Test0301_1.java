      Aimlessness has hardly been 《typical》 of the postwar Japan whose productivity and social harmony《1.和谐》 are the envy《2.嫉妒的》 of the United States and Europe.
  But increasingly the Japanese are seeing a decline of the traditional work-moral values. Ten years ago young people were hard-working and
  saw their jobs as their 《3.primary》 reason for being, but now Japan has largely fulfilled its economic needs, and young people don't know
  where they should go next.

  但是越来越多的是日本看起来正在下降的传统工作道德价值观。十年前年轻人努力工作并且
  对待他们的工作视为《3.主要的》存在理由，但是现在日本已经大部分满足他们经济需求，并且年轻人不知道他们
  改去向何处。

     The coming of age of the postwar baby boom and an entry of women into the male-dominated job market have limited the opportunities of teen-agers who
  are already questioning the heavy personal sacrifices involved in 《1.climbing》 Japan1 s rigid social ladder to good schools and jobs.
  In a recent survey, it was found that only 24.5 percent of Japanese students were fully satisfied with school life,
  compared with 67.2 percent of students in the United States. In addition, far more Japanese workers 《expressed》  dissatisfaction with their jobs
  than did their 《2.counterparts》 in the 10 other countries 《3.surveyed》.

    /**    While often 《1.praised》 by foreigners for its emphasis on the basics, Japanese education tends to stress test taking and mechanical
  learning over creativity and self-expression. "Those things that do not show up in the test scores―personality, ability,
  《courage》 or humanity—are completely ignored,says Toshiki Kaifii, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's education
  committee . "《4.Frustration》 against this kind of thing leads kids to 《drop out》 and run wild. " Last year Japan experienced 2,125 《5.incidents》
  of school 《6.violence》, including 929 assaults on teachers. Amid the 《outcry》, many 《7.conservative》 leaders are seeking a return to the prewar
  emphasis on moral education. Last year Mitsuo Setoyama, who was then education 《8.minister》, raised eyebrows when he argued that liberal
  reforms introduced by the American occupation authorities after World War II had 《9.weakened》 the "Japanese morality of respect for parents .”
  虽然经常被外国人《1.称赞》重视基础，日本教育倾向于加强测试和
  机械学习超过创造性和自我表达。分数没有展示出来的事情是-个性，能力

    /**   But that may have more to do with Japanese life-styles.  "In Japan",' says educator Yoko Muro, "it's never a question of whether
  you enjoy your job and your life, but only how much you can endure . ” With economic growth has come centralization;
  fully 76 percent of Japan's 119 million citizens live in cities where community and the extended family have been abandoned in favor of isolated,
  two generation households. Urban Japanese have long endured lengthy commutes (travels to and from work) and 《1.crowded》 living 《2.conditions》,
  but as the old group and family 《3.values weaken》, the 《4.discomfort》 is beginning to tell. In the past decade, the Japanese 《5.divorce》 rate,
  while still well below that of the United States, has increased by more than 50 percent, and 《6.suicides》 have increased by nearly one-quarter
  但是这可能和日本生活习惯有关系，在日本教育家Yoko Muro 说 从来都不是问题在享受生活和享受工作兼，而是你有多少忍耐力，经济成长伴随着和集中；
  日本119亿众76%的城市居民住在城市的《社区；部落》和他们 已经抛弃家庭和社区，
  两代人的家庭构成。日本人已经长期忍受高成本通勤和《1.拥挤的》生活《2.条件》，
  但是随着旧的群体和家庭价《3.值观的削弱》，《4.不满；不舒服》开始显现。在过去十年，日本《5.离婚》率，
  任然低于美国，但是又有上升50%，并且《6.自杀》已经上升了1/4.
